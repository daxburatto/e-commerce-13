## Description

E-Commerce is the backend of a traditional commercial business using Express.js and Sequelize to communicate with mySQL. This will allow users to GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE data for a business, it also allows you to sort by category, product, or specific tag items. Enter your credentials into dotenv and populate the database and you're all set.
